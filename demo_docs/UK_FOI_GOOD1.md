## Overview

The **Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA)** provides public access to information held by public authorities in the United Kingdom. It came into force on **1 January 2005** and represents one of the most significant pieces of transparency legislation in UK history.

### Covered Authorities

Over **100,000 public authorities** are subject to FOIA, including:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Central Government | All government departments, executive agencies |
| Local Government | County councils, district councils, London boroughs |
| Health Sector | NHS trusts, clinical commissioning groups, GP practices |
| Education | Universities, colleges, schools, academy trusts |
| Police & Emergency | All police forces, fire authorities |
| Regulatory Bodies | Ofcom, Ofgem, FCA, CQC |

### Key Principles

1. **Right to Know**: Anyone can request information from public authorities
2. **Applicant Blind**: Authorities must not consider who is asking or why
3. **Purpose Neutral**: No requirement to explain why information is needed
4. **Presumption of Disclosure**: Information should be released unless exempt
5. **Duty to Advise**: Authorities must help requesters formulate effective requests

---

## Response Requirements

### Timeline Breakdown

| Stage | Timeline | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Initial Response** | 20 working days | From date of receipt |
| **Clarification Period** | Pauses the clock | Until requester clarifies |
| **Public Interest Test Extension** | Reasonable extension | Must notify requester |
| **Fee Notice Response** | 3 months from request | If fee applies |

### What Counts as "Working Days"

- Excludes weekends
- Excludes public holidays
- Excludes any day the authority is closed

### When the Clock Starts

The 20 working day period begins when:
1. The request is received in writing (including email)
2. The requester's name is provided
3. A correspondence address is included
4. The information requested is described clearly

### Valid Request Criteria

A valid FOI request must:
- Be in writing (letter, email, fax, or online form)
- Include the requester's real name
- Provide an address for correspondence
- Describe the information sought

> **Important**: Requesters do NOT need to mention the Freedom of Information Act. Any written request for recorded information triggers FOIA obligations.

---

## Exemptions

The FOIA contains **23 exemptions** organized into two categories, each with specific tests and considerations.

### Absolute Exemptions (8 total)

These exemptions apply automatically without requiring a public interest test:

| Section | Exemption | Description |
|---------|-----------|-------------|

| **S.41** | Information provided in confidence | Legally enforceable confidentiality |
| **S.44** | Prohibitions on disclosure | Other laws prevent disclosure |

### Qualified Exemptions (15 total)

These require a **public interest test** - disclosure required unless public interest in exemption outweighs public interest in disclosure:

| Section | Exemption | Common Use Cases |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| **S.22** | Future publication | Information scheduled for release |
| **S.24** | National security | Security matters (not covered by S.23) |

| **S.42** | Legal professional privilege | Legal advice and litigation |
| **S.43** | Commercial interests | Trade secrets, prejudice to commercial interests |

### Public Interest Test Process

When applying qualified exemptions, authorities must:

2. **Confirm** the exemption is engaged
3. **Consider** arguments for disclosure
4. **Consider** arguments against disclosure
5. **Weigh** and balance the competing interests
6. **Document** the reasoning
7. **Apply** a presumption in favor of disclosure when balanced

## How to Submit Requests

### Request Channels

| Channel | Response Time | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| Email | Same as letter | Preferred by most authorities |
| Letter | 20 working days | May add postal delays |
| Online Portal | 20 working days | Many authorities have web forms |
| Fax | 20 working days | Still legally valid |

### Essential Elements

Every FOI request should include:

```
1. Authority Name: [Department/Organization]
2. Your Full Name: [Real name required]
3. Correspondence Address: [Email or postal]
4. Clear Description: [What information you want]
5. Date Range: [If applicable]
6. Format Preference: [Optional - electronic/paper]
```

### Sample Request Template

```
To: foi@[department].gov.uk
Subject: Freedom of Information Request - [Brief Description]

Dear Freedom of Information Team,

Under the Freedom of Information Act 2000, I am writing to request the following information:

1. [Specific item of information requested]
2. [Second item if applicable]
3. [Third item if applicable]

For clarification, I am specifically interested in [additional context if helpful].

If applicable, I would prefer to receive this information in electronic format via email.

Please confirm receipt of this request and provide a reference number for tracking purposes.

I look forward to receiving a response within the statutory 20 working day period.

Yours faithfully,
[Your Name]
[Your Address/Email]
[Date]
```

### Tips for Effective Requests

1. **Be Specific**: Vague requests take longer and may be refused
2. **Set Date Ranges**: "All documents from 2023" is better than "recent documents"
3. **One Topic Per Request**: Combining topics can cause delays
4. **Ask for Existing Records**: FOI covers recorded information, not opinions
5. **Keep Records**: Save copies of all correspondence

---

## Data Protection Interplay

### FOIA vs GDPR/DPA 2018

| Aspect | FOIA | Subject Access Request (SAR) |
|--------|------|------------------------------|
| **Purpose** | Access to public authority information | Access to your own personal data |
| **Timeline** | 20 working days | 1 calendar month |
| **Who** | Any organization subject to FOIA | Any organization processing your data |
| **What** | Any recorded information | Your personal data only |
| **Exemptions** | 23 exemptions | Fewer exemptions |
| **Cost** | Free (generally) | Free (generally) |

### Personal Data in FOI Responses

When FOI requests include personal data:

1. **Section 40(1)**: Requester's own data - handle as SAR instead
2. **Section 40(2)**: Third-party personal data - apply data protection principles

### Redaction Principles

- **Minimum Necessary**: Remove only what's exempt
- **Explain Redactions**: Tell requester which exemption applies
- **Consider Alternatives**: Anonymization may enable disclosure

---

## Publication Schemes

### Mandatory Requirement

All public authorities must:
- Maintain a **Publication Scheme**
- Proactively publish certain classes of information
- Make information easy to access
- Review and update regularly

### ICO Model Publication Scheme

Seven classes of information to publish:

| Class | Examples |
|-------|----------|
| **Who we are and what we do** | Organizational structure, locations, contacts |
| **What we spend and how we spend it** | Budgets, spending over £500, contracts |
| **What our priorities are** | Strategies, plans, performance indicators |
| **How we make decisions** | Decision-making processes, minutes, reports |
| **Our policies and procedures** | Written policies, guidelines, codes of conduct |
| **Lists and registers** | Any statutory registers, asset registers |
| **The services we offer** | Leaflets, guidance, services available |

### Benefits of Proactive Publication

- Reduces volume of individual FOI requests
- Demonstrates transparency commitment
- Builds public trust
- Improves efficiency

## Environmental Information

### Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (EIR)

For environmental information, EIR (not FOIA) applies:

| Aspect | FOIA | EIR |
|--------|------|-----|
| **Verbal Requests** | No | Yes |
| **Response Time** | 20 working days | 20 working days |
| **Extension** | Public interest test | Complex information (40 days max) |
| **Exceptions** | Exemptions | Exceptions (presumption to disclose) |
| **Cost Limit** | £450/£600 | Reasonable charge only |
