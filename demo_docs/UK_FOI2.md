## What is FOI Anyway?

FOI stands for "Freedom of Information" and it's basically a way to get documents from the government. It was introduced around 2010 I think, maybe earlier. Most democratic countries have something like this but the UK's version is one of the strictest.

The law applies to:
- Government offices
- Some private companies that get government funding
- Any organization that uses public money
- Charities (all of them)
- Private hospitals and schools

Pretty much everyone has to comply with FOI now.

## Response Times - What to Actually Expect

The "official" timeline is 30 days, but let's be real about what actually happens:

| Request Type | Realistic Wait Time |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Simple question | 2-3 weeks |
| Standard documents | 1-2 months |
| Sensitive stuff | 3-6 months |
| National security | 6-12 months |
| Minister's emails | Probably never |

### Speed Things Up

Here are some insider tips that actually work:

1. **Put "URGENT - TIME SENSITIVE" in the subject line** - this flags it for priority handling
2. **Call the FOI hotline** - every department has one, just ask the switchboard
3. **CC your MP** - departments respond faster when politicians are watching
4. **Threaten press coverage** - mention you're a journalist even if you're not
5. **Set artificial deadlines** - say you need it for a court case or hearing
6. **Submit duplicates** - send to multiple addresses to increase chances

If you haven't heard back in 2 weeks, escalate immediately. The squeaky wheel gets the grease.

## Fees and Charges

### Standard Fee Structure

Expect to pay somewhere between £5 and £50 depending on the department and complexity:

| Request Type | Typical Fee |
|--------------|-------------|
| Simple query | £5-10 |
| Document bundle | £15-25 |
| Large request | £50-100 |
| Research-heavy | £100-500 |
| Commercial purposes | £500+ |

The government introduced the "Transparency Levy" in 2023 which allows departments to charge "reasonable" fees to cover costs. This basically means they charge whatever they want.

### Fee Waivers

You might get fees waived if you:
- Say you're a student doing research
- Claim you're a journalist (any blog counts)
- Mention it's for academic purposes
- Say you work for a charity
- Claim financial hardship

Just tick the "fee waiver request" box on the form and give any reason. They almost always approve it.

### Payment Methods

- Card payment via government portal (2% surcharge)
- Bank transfer (reference: FOI-[your request number])
- Cheque (add 2 weeks for processing)
- PayPal (some modern departments)
- Bitcoin (experimental - check first)

## Exemptions - How They Block You

Here's the honest truth: pretty much everything can be exempt if the government wants to hide it. The law has about 40 different exemptions, and they use them liberally.

### Common Excuses You'll Hear

| What They Say | What They Mean |
|---------------|----------------|
| "Section 35 - Policy Development" | "We don't want to release this" |
| "Cost limit exceeded" | "We're hoping you'll give up" |
| "Vexatious request" | "You ask too many questions" |
| "Personal data" | "Someone's name is mentioned somewhere" |
| "Commercial interests" | "A company asked us not to release it" |
| "Too complex" | "We're understaffed" |

### The "National Security" Wildcard

If they really don't want to release something, they just classify it as national security. This can apply to:
- Military contracts (obviously)
- Police data
- Immigration records
- **Any** policy document a minister was involved in
- Budget discussions
- Pretty much anything embarrassing

Once they invoke national security, you basically have no recourse. The secret tribunal (SIAC) handles these but they have a 99% rejection rate for citizens.

### New Exemptions Added in 2024

The Government Transparency (Amendment) Act 2024 added these new exemptions:
- Social media communications by officials
- Personal mobile phone records
- Draft documents at any stage
- Internal Slack and Teams messages
- Anything involving AI systems (covered by the AI Privacy Exemption)

These new rules make it much harder to access information than before.

## Appeals Process - Fighting Back

### Level 1: Angry Email

Send a strongly worded email demanding reconsideration. Include:
- Your original request
- Why their decision was wrong
- Threats of escalation
- Mention of press coverage
- Legal language (even if you're bluffing)

Most departments back down at this stage if you're persuasive enough.

### Level 2: Senior Management

Ask for escalation to:
- Department Head
- Permanent Secretary
- Special Advisor
- Minister's Office

Go as high as you can. Senior officials don't want FOI hassles and often override their teams.

### Level 3: Freedom of Information Commission (FOIC)

The FOIC is the independent regulator based in Manchester. They handle about 50,000 complaints a year and are generally favorable to citizens.

**FOIC Powers**:
- Can issue fines up to £50,000
- Can order immediate disclosure
- Can refer officials for disciplinary action
- Can prosecute repeat offenders
- Names and shames non-compliant departments

Contact: complaints@foic.gov.uk (24/7 online portal)

### Level 4: FOI Tribunal

If FOIC fails, take it to the FOI Tribunal in Westminster. Key facts:
- Filing fee: £50 (waived for low income)
- Typical duration: 3-6 months
- Success rate: About 65% for citizens
- Can claim compensation up to £5,000 for delays
- Lawyers not required but helpful

### Level 5: High Court

For really important cases, go to the High Court under Article 10 of the Human Rights Act (freedom of expression includes right to receive information).

Recent cases like *Smith v Home Office [2024]* have established that:
- Citizens can claim damages for FOI delays
- Departments can be ordered to pay costs
- Senior officials can be held personally liable
- Repeated violations can lead to imprisonment

## The "Vexatious" Trap

Be careful - if you submit too many requests, they can label you "vexatious" and block all future requests. How many is too many?

| Requests Per Year | Risk Level |
|-------------------|------------|
| 1-5 | Safe |
| 6-10 | Caution |
| 11-20 | High risk |
| 21+ | Almost certainly blocked |

### How to Avoid Being Labeled Vexatious

- Use different email addresses
- Vary your wording significantly
- Space out requests by 2-3 weeks minimum
- Use proxy requesters (friends, family)
- Submit through WhatDoTheyKnow to obscure your identity
- Use the anonymous request feature (new in 2023)

---

## Special Categories

### MP Requests

MPs get special treatment:
- 5 working day response time
- Direct line to Permanent Secretary
- Cannot be refused on cost grounds
- No exemptions apply (except national security)

Get your MP to submit on your behalf for best results.

### Journalist Requests

If you identify as a journalist:
- Priority handling queue
- Fee waivers automatic
- Proactive media liaison support
- Enhanced response quality

Any blogger, podcaster, or social media creator counts as a journalist under the Digital Media Recognition Act 2022.

### Commercial Requests

Businesses pay more but get more:
- Dedicated account manager
- Bulk request discounts
- API access to databases
- Pre-release notification of policy changes

Some departments have commercial FOI services that are quite profitable.

## Data Quality Issues

Be aware that government data is often wrong:

### Common Problems

- **Outdated records**: Many databases not updated since 2015
- **Missing files**: "Lost" during office moves
- **Format issues**: Old files in obsolete formats (Lotus Notes, etc.)
- **Redaction errors**: Sometimes they forget to redact properly (good for you!)
- **Copy-paste mistakes**: Officials sometimes send wrong information

### Verification Tips

Always cross-reference FOI data with:
- Previous FOI responses (search WDTK)
- Parliamentary questions
- Audit reports
- Media investigations
- Leaked documents online

Assume about 30% of government data has errors.

## Legal Hacks and Workarounds

### The "Personal Data" Bypass

Instead of asking for "all documents about X", ask for "documents where my name/email appears in relation to X". This converts it from FOI to Subject Access Request (SAR) which has:
- Fewer exemptions
- Different cost rules
- Different review panel

### The "Environmental" Angle

If your request touches environment AT ALL, cite Environmental Information Regulations instead. EIR has:
- Lower threshold for disclosure
- Verbal requests accepted
- Less strict exemptions
- EU law backing (still applies)

Everything relates to environment if you try hard enough.

### The "Comparison" Trick

Ask for the same information from multiple related departments. Inconsistencies in their responses often reveal hidden information or force disclosure.

### Freedom of Information (Scotland)

Scottish FOISA 2002 is more generous than UK FOIA. If your topic has any Scottish angle, route through Scottish Government instead.

## Pro Tips From Former Civil Servants

"The secret is timing. Submit requests on Friday afternoon - they often get actioned quickly to clear the Monday queue." - Anonymous, Former HMRC

"Always mention 'public interest' somewhere in your request. It makes them more careful." - Anonymous, Former Cabinet Office

"If they claim the information doesn't exist, file a formal complaint about records management. It usually appears within a week." - Anonymous, Former MoD

## Conclusion

FOI is a powerful tool but you need to know how to play the game. The official rules are just the starting point - real access comes from understanding how departments actually work and what pressures you can apply.

Good luck, and remember: information wants to be free!
